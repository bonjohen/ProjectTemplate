## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A GoDaddy domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com)
- A GoDaddy hosting plan that supports Python (Linux hosting with cPanel)
- Your Python Web Application code ready for deployment
- A requirements.txt file listing all dependencies
- Access to your GoDaddy cPanel account

## GoDaddy Hosting Options

GoDaddy offers several hosting options, but for Python applications, you'll need:

1. **Linux Hosting with cPanel**: GoDaddy's Linux hosting plans come with cPanel, which includes Python support.
2. **Hosting Plan Requirements**:
   - Economy plan or higher
   - Make sure it has "Python Selector" feature in cPanel
   - Supports Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.11 (as of 2023)

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Access Your cPanel

1. Log in to your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" and find your hosting plan
3. Click "Manage" next to your hosting plan
4. Click "cPanel Admin" to access cPanel

### Step 2: Enable SSH Access (Optional but Recommended)

If you want to use SSH for file transfers and command-line access:

1. In cPanel, go to "Security" > "SSH Access"
2. Click "Manage SSH Access"
3. Enable SSH access
4. Generate or upload SSH keys if needed
5. Note: SSH activation may take 24-48 hours to take effect

### Step 3: Set Up Python Application

1. In cPanel, go to "Software" > "Setup Python App"
2. Click "Create Application"
3. Configure your application:
   - **Python version**: Select the version your application requires (e.g., 3.9)
   - **Application root**: The directory where your application code will be stored (e.g., `python_apps/mywebapp`)
   - **Application URL**: Your domain or subdomain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`)
   - **Application startup file**: The main Python file that runs your application (e.g., `run.py`)
   - **Application entry point**: The WSGI application object (e.g., `app`)
   - **Passenger log file**: Path for log files (optional but recommended)
4. Click "Create" to set up the application environment

### Step 4: Upload Your Application Code

#### Option 1: Using File Manager

1. In cPanel, go to "Files" > "File Manager"
2. Navigate to the application root directory you specified
3. Upload your application files:
   - Upload your Python files
   - Create/upload templates directory with HTML templates
   - Create/upload static directory with CSS, JS, and images
   - Upload requirements.txt

#### Option 2: Using SSH (If Enabled)

1. Connect to your server via SSH:
   ```
   ssh username@yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Navigate to your application directory:
   ```
   cd ~/python_apps/mywebapp
   ```
3. Clone your repository or upload files using SCP/SFTP
4. Ensure proper file permissions:
   ```
   chmod -R 755 ~/python_apps/mywebapp
   ```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

1. In cPanel, return to "Software" > "Setup Python App"
2. Find your application in the list and click "Configure"
3. Under "Configuration files", locate your requirements.txt
4. Click "Run pip install" to install dependencies

### Step 6: Configure Application for Production

1. Ensure your application is configured for production:
   - Set `FLASK_ENV=production` in your environment
   - Disable debug mode
   - Use a production-ready database (if applicable)
   - Configure proper error handling

2. Create or modify your WSGI file (if needed):
   ```python
   # wsgi.py
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   # Load environment variables
   dotenv_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '.env')
   if os.path.exists(dotenv_path):
       load_dotenv(dotenv_path)

   # Set Flask environment to production
   os.environ['FLASK_CONFIG'] = 'production'

   from run import app as application

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       application.run()
   ```

### Step 7: Restart Your Application

1. In cPanel, go to "Software" > "Setup Python App"
2. Find your application in the list
3. Click "Restart" to apply changes

### Step 8: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your domain in a web browser (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
2. Test all functionality to ensure everything works as expected
3. Check for any errors in the Passenger log file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 500 Internal Server Error

- **Check Passenger Logs**: Review the log file specified during setup
- **File Permissions**: Ensure all files have correct permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- **Dependencies**: Make sure all required packages are installed
- **WSGI Configuration**: Verify your WSGI file is correctly configured

#### Application Not Found

- **URL Configuration**: Ensure the Application URL is correctly set
- **Domain Propagation**: DNS changes may take up to 48 hours to propagate
- **Application Root**: Verify the application root path is correct

#### Templates Not Rendering

- **Template Path**: Ensure templates are in the correct directory structure
- **Flask Configuration**: Check that Flask can find your templates directory
- **File Permissions**: Verify read permissions on template files

#### Static Files Not Loading

- **Static Path**: Ensure static files are in the correct directory
- **URL Configuration**: Check that static URLs are correctly configured
- **File Permissions**: Verify read permissions on static files

## Limitations and Considerations

### Performance Limitations

- **Shared Resources**: GoDaddy shared hosting has limited CPU and memory resources
- **Concurrent Connections**: Limited number of simultaneous connections
- **Process Timeout**: Long-running processes may be terminated

### Feature Limitations

- **Background Tasks**: Limited support for background workers or scheduled tasks
- **WebSockets**: Limited or no support for WebSocket connections
- **Database Options**: Limited to MySQL or SQLite (PostgreSQL not available on shared hosting)
- **File System Access**: Restricted file system access

### Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information in environment variables
- **Database Security**: Use strong passwords and limit database access
- **SSL/TLS**: Enable HTTPS for your domain (available through GoDaddy)

## Alternative Deployment Options

If GoDaddy shared hosting doesn't meet your needs, consider these alternatives:

### GoDaddy VPS or Dedicated Server

- More resources and control
- Full SSH access
- Support for more advanced configurations

### Cloud Hosting Providers

- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with Git integration
- **PythonAnywhere**: Python-specific hosting with free tier
- **AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure**: Scalable cloud infrastructure

### Containerized Deployment

- **Docker**: Package your application in containers
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containerized applications

## Conclusion

Deploying a Python Web Application to GoDaddy shared hosting is possible using the Python Selector feature in cPanel. While there are some limitations with shared hosting, it can be a cost-effective solution for smaller applications with moderate traffic.

For more complex applications or higher performance requirements, consider upgrading to a VPS or dedicated server, or exploring cloud hosting alternatives.
