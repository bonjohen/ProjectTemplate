# Deployment Options for Python Web Application

This directory contains documentation for deploying the Python Web Application to various hosting environments.

## Available Deployment Guides

- [GoDaddy Shared Hosting](godaddy.md) - Deploy to GoDaddy shared hosting using cPanel and Python Selector

## Choosing the Right Deployment Option

When selecting a deployment option, consider the following factors:

### Application Requirements

- **Traffic Volume**: How many users will access your application?
- **Resource Needs**: CPU, memory, and storage requirements
- **Scalability**: Will your application need to scale up in the future?
- **Special Features**: WebSockets, background tasks, scheduled jobs, etc.

### Budget Considerations

- **Shared Hosting**: Most economical, but limited resources ($5-15/month)
- **VPS Hosting**: Better performance, more control ($20-80/month)
- **Dedicated Hosting**: Maximum performance and control ($80-200+/month)
- **Cloud Hosting**: Pay-as-you-go, highly scalable (varies based on usage)

### Technical Expertise

- **Shared Hosting**: Easiest to set up, limited configuration
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Easy deployment, managed infrastructure
- **VPS/Cloud**: Requires server administration knowledge
- **Containerized**: Requires Docker and possibly Kubernetes knowledge

## General Deployment Process

Regardless of the hosting provider, the deployment process typically involves these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Application**:
   - Ensure your application runs in production mode
   - Create a requirements.txt file
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up a WSGI entry point

2. **Choose a Hosting Provider**:
   - Select a provider that supports Python
   - Choose an appropriate plan based on your needs
   - Set up your domain and DNS settings

3. **Deploy Your Code**:
   - Upload your code to the server
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure the web server
   - Set up database connections

4. **Test and Monitor**:
   - Verify your application works correctly
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Configure backups
   - Implement security measures
