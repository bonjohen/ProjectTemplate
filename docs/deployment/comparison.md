## Migration Considerations

When migrating between platforms, consider these factors:

1. **Database Migration**: Export/import procedures differ between platforms
2. **Environment Variables**: Reconfigure for the new platform
3. **Static Files**: Update static file serving configuration
4. **Domain Configuration**: Update DNS settings
5. **SSL Certificates**: Reconfigure SSL for the new platform
6. **Deployment Process**: Adapt to the new platform's deployment workflow

## Conclusion

There's no one-size-fits-all solution for deploying Python web applications. The best choice depends on your specific needs, technical expertise, budget, and scaling requirements.

- **For beginners**: PythonAnywhere or Heroku provide the easiest path to deployment
- **For cost optimization**: DigitalOcean offers the best value for larger applications
- **For maximum control**: DigitalOcean gives you complete control over your environment
